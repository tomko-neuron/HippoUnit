# HippoUnit
This package contains the source code for [HippoUnit](https://github.com/KaliLab/hippounit)-validated CA1 pyramidal cell models. There are 4 models with reduced morphology and one model with complete morphology. The package is associated with a paper: [A new reduced-morphology model for CA1 pyramidal cells and its validation and comparison with other models using HippoUnit](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87002-7)

## Models tested
Five compartmental models of the CA1 pyramidal cell were used for testing. Models are available in the [ModelDB repository](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/). Our new model has been optimized based on HippoUnit tests, the others were not and hence served as controls. The model of Migliore et al. (2018) has been previously tuned for selected features of the somatic feature test and was therefore included as a reference (benchmark) model.
